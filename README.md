## Problem Sets using C

### mario.c

Create a right-aligned and left-aligned pyramid using hashes (#) where the user decides the height by entering a number between 1 and 8, inclusive.

### credit.c

Prompt the user for a credit card number and determine > whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, per the definitions of eachâ€™s format herein. 

**Note:**
- Luhn's Algorithm was used to determine credit card number validity 
- Assumption: The user's input is entirely numeric.

### readability.c

Prompt the user for a text and determine the reading level using the Coleman-Liau formula.

**Note:**
- Letter - any lowercase character from a-z or any uppercase character from A-Z
- Word - Sequence of character seperated by spaces
- End of sentence - Occurence of period, exclamation point, or question mark
- If index number is 16 or higher, output is > Grade16+
- If index number is less than 1, output is > Before Grade 1

### caesar.c

Via command-line argument, the user determines the cipher key and supplies a string of plaintext. The program outputs the user's original string as well as the encoded text that was computed using Caesar's algorithm. 

**Note:**
- Single command-line argument - a non-negative integer less than 2^31 - 26
- Case is preserved

### plurality.c 

Simulate a plurality vote election. Complete the vote and print_winner function.

vote
- Take the name of the candidate who was voted for and if matching candidate, update vote total
- Assumption: No two candidates have the same name

winner
- Print the name of the candidates that recieved the most votes in the election
- If tie, print the names of each winning candidates

### runoff.c

Implement a runoff election. Complete the implementation of vote, tabulate, print_winner, find_min, is_tie, and eliminate functions.

vote 
- Update voter's preference in global preferences array
-  Assumption: No two candidates have the same name

tabulate
- Update number of votes of each candidate at current stage in the runoff

print_winner
- If any candidate has more than 50% of the vote, print the winner
- If nobody has won yet, return false

find_min
- Return the minimum vote total for currently running candidates

is_tie
- If every current candidate has the same number of votes, return true; otherwise return false 

eliminate
- Eliminate candidate(s) who the minimum number of votes.

### speller.c

Spell-check a file using a hash table. Implement the load, hash, size, check, and unload functions. 

load
- Takes the dictionary file, and reads the words, and loads them into hashtable

hash 
- Takes a word and return numerical index between 0 and N-1, inclusive (implement hash function)
- Deterministic
- Allowed to source hash function

size
- Return number of words in dictionary

check
- Take a word and return true if the word is in the dictionary; false otherwise
- case-insensitive

unload
- Free up allocated memory 

**Note:**
- Assumptions: 
   - dictionary passed is >  alphabetically sorted from top to bottom with one word per line, each of which ends with \n
   - dictionary contains at least one word, and no word will be longer than LENGTH characters
   - no duplicate words, >  each word will contain only lowercase alphabetical characters and possibly apostrophes, and that no word will start with an apostrophe
   - > check will only be passed words that contain (uppercase or lowercase) alphabetical characters and possibly apostrophes
